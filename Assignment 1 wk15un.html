<h4> Reason why Kawhi LEFT the Toronto Raptors to Join the Los Angeles Clippers</h4>

<p><em>It became clear this off-season that Leonard, a native of Southern California, made going home a priority. But he raised the profile of the Raptors considerably during his short stay with the team, as evidenced by the championship parade that drew millions to the streets of Toronto.</em></P>

<p><em>"Best [championship] parade ever," </em>he said.</p>


<p><strong>He also thanked doctors in Toronto, where his partner gave birth to their second child, and for the Ka'Wine and Dine initiative at select Toronto restaurants that offered free food for Leonard during the post-season.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>"I took advantage of that," </em>he said with a laugh.</strong></p>

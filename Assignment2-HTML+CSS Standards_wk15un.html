<h4> What Barack Obama said about Sidney Crosby at the White House after Winning the Staney Cup according to NHL.com</h4>

<p>In 2009, when President Barack Obama welcomed the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins to the White House, he made it a point to congratulate the youngest captain ever to win the Cup, 21-year-old Sidney Crosby. Toward the end of the ceremony, Obama got a big laugh when he threw a little shade Crosby's way, remarking, <em>"Sidney must be really fast because there's some big hockey players -- and he's not one of them." </em></P>



<p><strong>How Sidney Crosby does not ease up during practice according to NHL.com</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>"Fortunately, the president got the chance to make amends. In October 2016, the champion Penguins returned to the White House, and Obama said: "Last time he was here, I took a cheap shot at Sid for his size. I wasn't the first one, on or off the ice. Of course since then, he's won two Olympic golds (2010, 2014), a World Championship (2015), a World Cup MVP (2016), a playoff MVP (2016), another NHL MVP (2014), a mountain of other postseason awards. ... And, of course, he hoisted this trophy right here, his second Stanley Cup.".</strong></p>
